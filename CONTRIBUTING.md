# Contributing

- Follow these commit guidelines: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
- Always run [`cargo fmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) as PART of your change. Do not format the code after you are done, as this makes the history useless (git blame will only show the formatting commit).
